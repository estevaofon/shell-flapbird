## :space_invader: About

This is a game that uses the Python `curses` library to create a console-based implementation of the game "Flappy Bird." In the game, the player controls a bird represented by the character "^" and must navigate it through a series of gaps in pipes represented by the character "|". The game uses random generation to create pipes, and the score increases every time a pipe is passed. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or hits the top or bottom of the screen. The user can control the bird's movement with the spacebar, and can quit the game by pressing the 'q' key.
