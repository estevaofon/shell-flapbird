## :space_invader: About

This code is a simple game in Python using the curses library. The game involves a bird that the user controls, and pipes that the bird must avoid or else the game ends. The screen size is set based on the maximum size of the terminal window the user is using. The pipes are generated randomly and move across the screen from right to left. Users can make the bird move upwards by pressing the space bar. The score is displayed at the top of the screen, and the game ends if the bird collides with the pipes or goes out of bounds. Finally, the game over message is displayed and the user can end the game by pressing the 'q' key.
