## :space_invader: About

This code is a console-based game in which a bird (represented by the symbol "^") has to fly and pass through gaps between pipes (represented by the symbol "|"). The user controls the bird's height using the spacebar key. The score increases by one every time the bird passes through a pair of pipes. If the bird hits the ceiling or the floor or collides with a pipe, the game is over. The game ends only when the user presses the "q" key to quit. The game speed is relatively slow, and the gap size between pipes is constant. The game is implemented using the curses Python library.
